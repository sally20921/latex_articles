\title{Humanocracy}
\maketitle

How did we end up with organizations so lacking courage, creativity, and passion?
Our organizations are inertial, incremental, and uninspiring. These are the core incompetencies of the corporation, and they're so pervasive that we can be forgiven for assuming they're irremediable.
We tell ourselves it's the nature of large organizations to be brittle and backward-looking, and to wish it otherwise is naive.

As human beings, we are resilient, inventive, and exuberant. The fact that our organizations are not suggests that in some important ways, they are less human than we are.
Ironically, it seems that human-built organizations have scant room for exactly those things that make us special-things like courage, intuition, love, playfulness and artistry.
If our organizations are inhuman, it's because we designed them to do so-whether consciously or not. 

If you believe that human beings deserve more from their jobs, and that we'd better served by more dynamic and inventive institutions, there's a ton you can do to move the world forward.
